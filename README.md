# BME Design Project

**Team:** Harvey Shi, Sam Fox, Drew Levy

**Client:** Chris DeGain, Liberty Commons Nursing and Rehabilitation Center

**Project goal:** to build a device to objectively measure peak percent of body weight loaded on a recovering limb while walking with upper body support from a  walker, cane, and/or parallel bars. This device should provide real-time feedback to the therapist and patient.

This project is occurring between September 2017 - May 2018.

By December 2017, we aim to have a first prototype of our design.
